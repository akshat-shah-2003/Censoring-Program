# Python-project

Sample text for preview:
Oh shoot, I thought I had the dang problem figured out. Darn it. Oh well, it was a heck of a freakin try.

Modules used:
1. tkinter
2. clipboard

Logic:
1. Add some curse words as strings in a list.
2. Iterate the list items and if the items in the list are also in the text provided, use replace function to replace it with "*"*len(i).
3. Also to replace capital letters use that if list_item.capitalize() is in the text, replace with "*"*len(i).

This was a group project.
Thanks to Anup Dhoble and Himanshu Sharma for assistance.
